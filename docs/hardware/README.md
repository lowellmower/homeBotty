### Hardware
This document serves to outline the various pieces of hardware (microcontrollers
and otherwise) used through out the project. It should be noted that there is a
plethora of various breakout boards, but largely the ESP8266 chip is by far the
backbone of this endeavor.

### ESP8266
TL;DR a WiFi chip use in a vast majority of modern day electronics. For my own
understanding and exploration of this chip, I've created a separate repository
[the ESP8266 repository](https://github.com/lowellmower/ESP8266), containing a
number of tools, diagrams, and basics of interacting with this chip (and others).
