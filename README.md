### Introduction
HomeBotty (play on [homebody](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=homebody), 
get it?) is a collection of various home automation bits and bobs meant to make
life at home integrated, automated, and simply _better_. The hope is that with
a non-trivial amount of effort, this repository will become a central place from
which software (or software configuration) can be coordinated, distributed, and
built upon for personal (and possibly public) consumption.

The TL;DR  goals of this project, which are expanded upon in the [goals](#goals)
section below, are to deliver a POC that can do some simple home automation tasks.
Some examples of these tasks are, toggling lights or outlets, monitor fuel 
consumption, locking or unlocking doors... you get the idea. Accompanying these
simple goals are a few tertiary objectives which provide value to those who may
not be as interested in the development of such systems and are more inclined to
relate to their ease of use or appearance. Those goals include an inviting web
based GUI, mobile integration and communication, and most importantly a bot.

The (slack)Bot in homeBotty will grow organically over time and eventually become
the most shared (and modular) part of this repository. My hope is that by
integrating with a mechanism which people are familiar interacting with, they will
become more likely to use the tools behind the interface. This lowers the entry
barrier to home automation and opens up other development opportunities like
machine learning, artificial intelligence, and usage data collection.
