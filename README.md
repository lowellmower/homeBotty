### Introduction
HomeBotty (play on [homebody](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=homebody), 
get it?) is a collection of various home automation bits and bobs meant to make
life at home integrated, automated, and simply _better_. The hope is that with
a non-trivial amount of effort, this repository will become a central place from
which software (or software configuration) can be coordinated, distributed, and
built upon for personal (and possibly public) consumption.

The TL;DR  goals of this project, which are expanded upon in the [goals](#goals)
section below, are to deliver a POC that can do some simple home automation tasks.
Some examples of these tasks are, toggling lights or outlets, monitor fuel 
consumption, locking or unlocking doors... you get the idea. Accompanying these
simple goals are a few tertiary objectives which provide value to those who may
not be as interested in the development of such systems and are more inclined to
relate to their ease of use or appearance. Those goals include an inviting web
based GUI, mobile integration and communication, and most importantly a bot.

The (slack)Bot in homeBotty will grow organically over time and eventually become
the most shared (and modular) part of this repository. My hope is that by
integrating with a mechanism which people are familiar interacting with, they will
become more likely to use the tools behind the interface. This lowers the entry
barrier to home automation and opens up other development opportunities like
machine learning, artificial intelligence, and usage data collection.

### Goals
This section is for defining present and future goals of the homeBotty project.
The intent is to create a project which can be expanded upon and contributed to
by clearly defining goals and laying out the objectives necessary to achieve
them. Each goal should correspond to a label and issue where work can be tracked
and collaborated upon.

#### G.0: Transparent Architecture
Offer high level design and modeling to communicate decisions and offer insight
into the pro/cons of how my own home automation was done.

Talk about different approaches and the software/tools already made which help to
bring this project to fruition.

Offer technical specifications where applicable exempli gratia dependencies,
operating systems, image sizes, etc.

#### G.1: Documentation
Produce easy to read, easy to find, delightful documentation. This will please
the Internet traveler who may stumble across this repository and garner praise
from your future more forgetful, but possibly better looking and most undoubtedly
smarter, future self.

#### G.2: Infrastructure
Servers, hosting, connectivity, monitoring, and the like. Infrastructure.

#### G.3: Backend
The business logic, API, and coordination of services.

#### G.4: User Interface (web)
The web accessible user interface.

#### G.5: Slack Bot
The personal assistant to consume the API and the core of the future project.

#### G.6: Physical Integration
Semi-permanent constructions, manipulation of walls, wiring, and the like. 

#### G.7: User Interface (mobile)
If I ever want to play with mobile development...

### Architecture
Should include a TL;DR here but have a directory in this repository which is more
explicitly meant for such things

### Getting Started
Should include a TL;DR here but have a directory in this repository which is more
explicitly meant for such things

### General Notes
This section is meant for collecting general notes which are quickly accessible
and most undoubtedly helpful. Links, rants, commands, help, etc.
